  welcome_view_faq_h3: FAQ
  welcome_view_faq_p_eight: Each guide has their own reimbursement policy. It will be clearly stated in the event before you complete the payment.
  welcome_view_faq_p_eleven: No. Once you commit with one guide, they are counting on your presence at their event. You cannot be in two places at the same time, right?
  welcome_view_faq_p_five: Truppie is the platform which external guides use to create their own truppies. The guides are responsible for the information provided, booking confirmation, payment, number of vacancies, cancellation etc - all done via Truppie website. The guide is the ultimate responsible for the event.
  welcome_view_faq_p_four: Not yet. Someday, who knows? In the meantime, it is merely the platform that supports the truppies organized by external guides.
  welcome_view_faq_p_nine: 'The organizing guide is the person who knows best about their own truppie, so we recommend you contact them directly by e-mail or telephone (provided in the event page). Anyway, in case of any problems, Truppie will be glad to help too :) '
  welcome_view_faq_p_one: No. We are a platform that connects guides (independent or from local travel agencies) to people who seek for tours, trips and other types of experiences.
  welcome_view_faq_p_seven: On Truppie, you pay directly through the website with credit card. Once the payment is confirmed, your place is automatically reserved.
  welcome_view_faq_p_six: For now, in Brazil, in the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais. But we have plans to expand to other regions.
  welcome_view_faq_p_ten: If you are any kind of guide (travel, nature, adventure, photography, yoga etc), either working independently or in an agency, and - very important - if you feel synergy between our values, you are welcome to join Truppie as our guide!
  welcome_view_faq_p_three: Any type of adventure/trip/tour that brings a new, enriching and inspiring experience. Something that contributes to your development as a human being.
  welcome_view_faq_p_two: Trip + Hippie + Troupe = Truppie <br /> A new concept of lifestyle and life philosophy.

  welcome_view_how_h4_five: Ok, but who does what?
  welcome_view_how_h4_four: Who does
  welcome_view_how_h4_one: What it is

  welcome_view_how_h4_two: What we do
  welcome_view_how_h5_five: Cancellation policy
  welcome_view_how_h5_four: How we do
  welcome_view_how_h5_one: The Guide
  welcome_view_how_h5_six: Responsibility
  welcome_view_how_h5_three: The Truppie
  welcome_view_how_h5_two: The Explorer
  welcome_view_how_p_eight: The Guide can be an independent professional, or linked to some local agency. They sign up on the platform Truppie, create a profile and create how many truppies as they want. The Guides registration goes through a verification, in order for us to assure the quality of the services providers.
  welcome_view_how_p_eleven: No bureaucracy, no difficulty, with transparency, from our hearts.
  welcome_view_how_p_fifteen: 'In case the Guide cancels the event, the Explorer has two options: 1) refund of 100%  or 2) leave the credit with the Guide to be used in a future truppie of their own choice.'
  welcome_view_how_p_five: 'To sum up: Truppie does… truppies! Tours, trails, hikes, events, trips… for us, all kinds of adventures are called truppies. So, what is your truppie?'
  welcome_view_how_p_four: We want to show that life can be much more interesting when we prioritize what really makes a difference,  what enriches our soul. There resides the key to the true happiness - dettach from material goods, be present and see beauty in each and every moment.
  welcome_view_how_p_fourteen: Once the Explorer chooses their truppie, the payment is easily made on the website with credit card; and then, voilà, the truppie is booked!
  welcome_view_how_p_nine: The Explorer can be me, you, any person in search of a new experience. He/she signs up and also has a profile, with information about their preferences. The explorer finds their truppie, books and pays through the website.
  welcome_view_how_p_one: Welcome to Truppie family! Have a better understanding of what is Truppie and how it works.
  welcome_view_how_p_seven: Truppie is made by people like you and me. It's people who love what they do on one side, and people who are in love with life on the other side. It's a lot of good energy all together!
  welcome_view_how_p_seventeen: 'To sum up: whether you are a Guide or an Explorer, Truppie wants to make things easy for you, so that more people can have the best experiences of their lives! :)'
  welcome_view_how_p_six: "...our brain is capable of forming new synapses (connection between nerve cells) when stimulated by new factos? This is called neuroplasticity. That means that when we explore and live new situations, we are learning, and our brain, developing. And this is one of the greatest contributors to creativity. So, not only living new adventures is distracting and pleasurable, it is also healthy and productive!"
  welcome_view_how_p_sixteen: Truppie gives the guides freedom to create and manage their own events; they are responsible for booking confirmation, payment, number of vacancies and cancellation. Even though the ultimate responsibility for the event resides with the organizing Guide, Truppie will help with whatever is possible in order to provide the Explorer with the best experience.
  welcome_view_how_p_ten: Truppie is the platform that connects the Explorer in quest for their next adventure and the Guide who offers it. The Guide creates their own events (aka 'truppies') on our website, which in turn gives the Explorer all the information, support and orientation they need in order to book their tour.
  welcome_view_how_p_thirteen: 'If there are questions specifically about the event, the Explorer should contact the Guide. If it''s a more general question (eg: about different truppies or guides), Truppie is always at your disposal.'
  welcome_view_how_p_three: 'Truppie came to take you out of normal life: school, work, bills, consumism, sedentary lifestyle, boredom, lack of purpose. Truppie is here to present you new possibilities of enjoying your time, feeding your soul and developing as a person. How? Having fun, discovering oneself, exploring new places, making new friends, living new experiences!'
  welcome_view_how_p_twelve: 'The truppies are offered by the Guides registered in our platform; they provide all the necessary information so that the Explorer can book the tour straight from the website: date, place, duratino, price, pre-requisites, physical difficulty, required equipments, vacancies, etc.'
  welcome_view_how_p_two: Truppie is a platform that connects people to many adventures.
